          </a>
          <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q1_3">
            <p><b>Market Cap:</b> Market capitalization is the market value of a publicly traded company's
              outstanding shares. Market capitalization is equal to the share price multiplied by the
              number of shares outstanding.</p>

              is able to generate from its assets.</p>

            <p><b>Relation:</b> Relation shows the cost type of two companies. There are 3 types of relations: COGS,
              SG&A and CAPEX.
              <b>COGS:</b> Cost of goods sold is the expense most directly involved in creating revenue.
              It represents the costs of producing or purchasing the goods or services sold by the company.

              <b>SG&A:</b> Selling, general & administrative expense. This category includes marketing, salaries,
              utility bills, technology expenses and other general costs associated with running a business.

              <b>CAPEX:</b> Capital expenditures are funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical
              assets such as property, buildings, an industrial plant, technology, or equipment.</p>

          </a>
          <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q1_4">
            In order to analyze the effect of China-US trade war on the supply chain, China(mainland), Hong Kong and USA
            are
            classified as special regions in this network. That is, China(mainland) and Hong Kong are not included in
            APAC region, and the United States is not included in North America region.

          </a>
          <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q1_5">
            The color of a node represents a company’s role in the network, manufacturer, tier 1 supplier or tier 2
            supplier.<br>
            The size of a node represents a company’s market capital.<br>

            Q2.1 What are <span class="font-italic">Borrow Need</span>, <span class="font-italic">Risk Score</span> and <span class="font-italic">FX Need</span>?
          </a>
          <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q2_1">
            These 3 scores represents the business opportunities and risks of the respective companies within the network. The formula are as below: <br>
            <br>
            <p><b>Borrow Need:</b> Abnormal Change of Inventories – Abnormal Change of cash</p>
            <p><b>Risk Score:</b> Abnormal Change of D/E ratio</p>
            <p><b>FX Need:</b> Number of Foreign Suppliers</p>
            All the scores are standardized by min-max transformation which scaled from 0 to 1. Hence, the score here is relative but not absolute.
            <br><br>
            The rationale behind:
            <br>
            <p><b>Borrow Need:</b> Increase in inventory and/or decrease in cash decrease operation efficiency</p>
            <p><b>Risk Score:</b> Increase in D/E ratio decrease financial flexibility</p>
            <p><b>FX Need:</b> Increase in foreign suppliers increase FX opportunities</p>

            Q2.2 What does <span class="font-italic">Abnormal Change</span> mean?
          </a>
          <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q2_2">
              The abnormal changes equal to the actual performances divided by the expected performances minus 1.
              In order to get the estimated performances, we utilize three-factor model to calculate the expected financial performances as if there is no trade war. 
              <br> <br>
              This methodology is adopted from event study. An event study is a statistical method to assess the impact of an event on the value of a firm. 
              For example, the announcement of a merger between two business entities can be analyzed to see whether investors believe the merger will create or destroy value. 
              The basic idea is to find the abnormal return attributable to the event being studied by adjusting for the return that stems from the price fluctuation of the market as a whole. 
              The event study was invented by Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969).

            Q2.3 How to use the timeline and what are the differences?
          </a>
          <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q2_3">
              We have six snapshots in our timeline. You can slide to see the changes of the network and the respective HexaNet Scores.
              <br> Note that for the HexaNet Score, we cannot provide them before the trade war period. 
              It is because this is the measurement of tradewar impact so cannot be generalised for daily usage.

              Q2.4 What do the colors of the nodes mean on network and scatter plot?
            </a>
            <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q2_4">
                <p><b>On the network graph:</b><br>
                The color represents the degree of the score. The lower the score, the color is more yellowish. 
                The higher the degree, the color is be more reddish. 3 scores shared the same scale.
                  <br>
                  <p><b>On the scatter plot:</b><br>
                  The color represents the degree of the HexaNet score. The lower the score, the color is more yellowish. 
                The higher the degree, the color is be more purple.
                <br>
                HexaNet Score is an aggregated score using Euclidean metric. Here is the formula:
                <br>
                
                $$HexaNet\ Score = \sqrt{Borrow\ Need^2+FX\ Need^2+(1-Risk)^2} $$

              Q2.5 What is <span class="font-italic">Industry Landscape</span>?
            </a>
            <div class="collapse text-answer" id="q2_5">
                Industry landscape contains the financial metrics abnormal changes on the country aggregate level. 
                Besides that, it contains how financial abnormal changes correlate with their proportion of US or Chinese supplier. 
                There are 2 degree measurements. <br> <br> Firstly, it is US/CN degree and its applied to manufacturers only. 
                This measures how much portion of Chinese suppliers is for the US manufacturers and how much portion of US supplier is for the Chinese manufacturers. 
                The proportion has accounted the second-tier suppliers already.
                <br> <br> Secondly, it is RC degree and its applied to first-tier supplier only. 
                This measures the portion of Chinese supplier and customers for the US suppliers. Same logic applies to Chinese suppliers. This degree balanced the revenue and cost effect by COGS ratio.
